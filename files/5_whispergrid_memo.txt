Dear Malcolm, 

To update you on the preparations for the AGM. 
Lucca and Honk have confirmed attendance, even though their divisions are dragging down the company 
it is important to have them here, if things get interesting, we already have a plan b. 
I wouldn't want it to be like last year, when the two of them clashed after the cocktail party.
We all know Lucca can't drink. 

I've already arranged the hotel and the catering, I've asked Honk, for the same show as last year, 
to look after the 'entertainments'. I have added his invoice to the original budget to see if we can 
improve the figures for the investors. We don't want them to see any negative numbers during the congress. 

We will be using D'Angelo as a speaker, he owes us a few favours after saving his ass in Malaysia. 
Luckily he encrypted the files before hiding them on the intranet. Knowing him, he might have used his father's name as the password. 
The supply contract is still on the table, so I don't think he'll do anything stupid like talk 
to MÃ¼ller or Williams, but I've reminded my assistant to put them on separate desks on the pretext 
that they hate each other. Please, if he asks you, just follow my example. 

Anyway, the contracts have already been signed by the Minister, so I assume they will go ahead. 
All that's left is for you to finalise the tender documents and we'll have everything. 
Remember to check what I sent you in case the figures need to be changed for the meeting. 
There is a breakdown of the payments to each department.
